  <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the concept that ours brain are constantly growing and changing in response to the challenges we take on each day. There are two main types of neuroplasticity, structural neuroplasticity - the brain changing its physical structure, and functional neuroplasticity - the ability of the brain to shift functions from one part (which might be damaged, for example) to a different part of the brain.
    </p>

    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
    <p>
      By understanding the principles of neuroplasticity people become aware that their brain and intelligence aren't fixed, and that by putting in effort on difficult tasks their brains are adapting and growing. This provides motivation to persevere with challenges that they may be struggling with. Also, it can help you to understand that time spent struggling on a problem isn't wasted time. It also explains why you are worse at a skill you have not used or practiced for some time, the brain has "pruned" some of those unused neural pathways.
    </p>
      
    <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
    <p>
      If there are skills you wish to develop then dedicate time to regularly practice those (or even imagine practicing them) and this will improve the related neural pathways. Use this understanding as motivation when facing difficult obstacles.
    </p>
      
    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      In general, by practicing and learning new skills will increase your neuroplasticity. Some good examples of things you could try are: learn a new language, travel somewhere new, practice a form of art, practice using your non-dominant hand, learn to juggle, play chess. Even playing video games can have positive benefits for changing your brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other factors, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, meditation, getting adequate sleep and/or taking naps also increase neuroplasticity as well.

    <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoyed the list of ways to increase your neuroplasticity in <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain" target="_blank">this article</a>. these practical suggestions demonstrate that this doesn't need to be hard work, but it can actually be fun enhancing your brain.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
    <p>
      A growth mindset is the belief that with effort you can improve upon your current intelligence/skills. With the opposite of a growth mindset, a fixed mindset, one believes that their abilities and intelligence are fixed and unchangeable. Without a growth mindset, there is little point in embarking on a new challenge if you will not come out the other side improved by your efforts; if your abilities are fixed then what is the point in trying to change them?
    </p>

    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>
      I have learned about fixed vs growth mindset previously, so this was mostly revision for me. It did help to remind me of the importance of adopting a growth mindset and the impressive results that can come about when people do so. When I was younger I used to tutor students and have witnessed first hand how self-limiting beliefs can hold people back.
    </p>

    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>
      I will understand that by working on my abilities I am able to improve upon them. I will also try to see challenges and frustrations as a part of the learning journey. I will try to be aware of when I am adopting more of a fixed mindset outlook and think about what I can do to move myself more towards a growth mindset. Rather than focus on my level of ability, I will try to value my level of improvement.
    </p>

    <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4" target="_blank">this video</a>, as it explained that rather than binary states, the fixed and growth mindsets are more like a continuum. It highlighted that certain environments can help to foster people adopting a growth mindset, but it also warned that certain triggers or situations (such as being compared with others) are likely to put people into a fixed mindset mode.

    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>

    <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
    <p>
      I think that my learning plan is more or less consistent with these understandings. I generally have a high level of determination and enjoy figuring out challenging problems - which sounds like a growth mindset approach. I do, however, usually focus on achievement and completing a goal, so I may need to shift my focus somewhat and understand that a partially completed goal can still be a "win" and may have led to a lot of learning and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      My current routine incorporates a number of things which are beneficial for neuroplasticity; regular exercise, decent amount of sleep each night, dancing, learning (Brazilian) Portuguese.
