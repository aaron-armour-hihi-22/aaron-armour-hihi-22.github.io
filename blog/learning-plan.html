  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

  <h2>Sprint-5 version of my learning plan</h2>
  <h5>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h5>
  <p>
    I am hoping to use the knowledge and experience from Dev Academy to get into the Tech industry as a developer. Longer term I am open to moving around within the tech sector following my interests, data science is an area that sounds like it might appeal to me.
  </p>

  <h5>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h5>
  <p>
    I think my biggest strengths are that I already have a decent knowledge of programming (mostly Python, but some others too) and also that I get on well with other people. I have already noticed during foundations that having experience programming in other languages seems to have made learning JavaScript easier than it would have been if I didn't have this prior experience. The fact that I approach problems methodically, I'm analytical and thorough will also be a strength for Bootcamp.
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of limitations, I am quite invested in my own ideas/approaches so I think there might be a bit of adapting necessary when I do pair programming and work on joint projects. At times I can be overly ambitious with what I want to accomplish with a project and then that can make it quite overwhelming. This combined with a perfectionist streak can be problematic and sometimes can make it difficult to get started on the project.
  </p>

  <h5>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h5>
  <p>
    I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be adapting to the Bootcamp schedule, thus far I've been able to work through material quicker than a lot of the timebox suggestions (Sprint 2 was probably the exception) and also have had flexibility as to when I do my work on the foundations. The earlier starts for commuting, in particular, will take some getting used to.
  </p>

  <h5>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
  <p>
    I would like to develop more self-confidence and be more assertive. I would like to establish a good work rhythm, working at a sustainable pace, having fun and not getting too stressed. I would like to practice keeping my perfectionism in check. I would like to practice time-management, so that I can carve out some times for my other interests.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would like to improve my interpersonal communication skills and my ability to work collaboratively and be a great team member. I would also like to practice mentoring other students when I have knowledge/skills to share.
  </p>

  <h5>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h5>
  <p>
    These are similar to my expectations from the Foundations facilitators; to help us to remove blocks when we have tried other avenues without success, to make sure that we are on track with our work and to provide us feedback when we are not meeting the necessary requirements, and a general watch over us to make sure we are not overworking and at risk of burnout, or not keeping up with the workload and pace of the course.
  </p>

  <h5>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h5>
  <p>
    I will make Bootcamp my highest priority time commitment, and it will be my main focus on weekdays. However, it is important for me to keep balance and also devote some of my time to other interests and rest/relaxation as well. I will do my best to "show up" and be an active participant in activities even if they are a bit uncomfortable.
  </p>
  <p>
    I plan to approach Bootcamp in the same way that I described when I did this exercise earlier at the start of Foundations. I also plan to seek help in a similar way, except that because I will be working on campus with other students, I expect that helping each other will happen earlier than it did during foundations. I still like to figure things out on my own, but when there is time pressure, asking other students earlier on rather than battling on alone could save valuable time.

  <h2>Sprint-2 version of my learning plan</h2>
  <h5>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h5>
  <p>
    I would like to work in the tech industry, initially as a developer, but longer term I am open to exploring other roles in the tech space. I would love to work in a job which also uses some of my skills and knowledge of mathematics (from University studies).
  </p>
  
  <h5>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h5>
  <p>
    I am determined and do work hard, particularly when I enjoy what I am working on. I think in quite an analytical/logical way which will probably be helpful for some of the technical parts of this course. I am curious and enjoy learning, however I probably need to ensure I don't get too sidetracked and lose time on interesting things that are only tangentially related.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes I might get bogged down in the detail and not see the bigger picture, and for instance, may spend too long working on a small part of the problem. I enjoy figuring things out myself, and at times I should ask for help sooner than I do. I do have a tendency to be a little impatient and want to know it all now! So I will need to keep that in check, practice patience and trust the process.
  </p>
  
  <h5>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
  <p>
    A big skill I would like to develop is self-confidence about my abilities and what I can achieve. I would also like to improve my time management, and ability to set and meet deadlines (as this is a skill I haven't had to use for some time). It would be good to improve my decision making, I can often struggle to make a decision when there is no clear 'best option', as I can see the benefits and drawbacks of each course of action. I think that my communication skills and ability to work well with others are both reasonable, but further improving these would definitely be useful.
  </p>
  
  <h5>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
    <ul>
        <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
        <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
    </ul>
  </h5>
  <p>
    I have made Dev Academy my main priority until when it comes to an end. Having said that I hope that I am able to also fit in some time for hobbies, rest and relaxation etc around the course work. I prefer to work at a steady pace rather than rushing to complete things just before a deadline, so I plan to put in a good level of consistent effort throughout. I will endeavour to maintain a good sleep routine so that I can perform at my best. I will try to break down work into smaller manageable tasks, and use time management tools to help keep making consistent progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    I see that the other learners and I are in this together, so will constructively work with them to ensure that we all get the most out of this experience. I know that the facilitators are here to help us help ourselves, so I will value and trust their guidance.
  </p>      
  <p>
    If things are building up, then I might need to take a step back, work out what is required, plan for how to complete those things, and perhaps accept that it might just be enough to get it done rather than doing it amazingly. I may also need to ease back and make some space for a bit more downtime (probably in the evenings and weekends) and make sure that I am looking after myself, making adequate time for sleep, eating well etc.
  </p>
  
  <h5>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h5>
  <p>
    If I get stuck with something and am not able to resolve it myself, I will see if the other learners are able to help me. If I am not able to find an answer that way then I will seek help from a facilitator. I will endeavour to resolve problems within a reasonable timeframe so that I am not 'blocked' for too long (as work will probably start building up).
  </p>
  
  <h5>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h5>
  <p>
    I expect that the Facilitation team will guide us on our learning journey and will work to help us resolve our issues if we get stuck and other avenues haven't fixed the issue. Ideally the Facilitation team will keep a general watch over us and let us know if they notice we are overworking and at risk of burning ourselves out, or if we do not seem to be keeping up and need to speed up.
  </p>
  
  <h5>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h5>
  <p>
    My only regularly scheduled commitments are dance practice Thursday evenings, 5:30-6:30pm, and socials fortnightly on Wednesday nights, 8-10pm.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would also like to find time for some of my other usual activities, such as training at the gym, but realise that these may need to be scaled back somewhat and will need to be flexible around timing.
